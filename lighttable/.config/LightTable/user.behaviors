;; User behaviors
;; -----------------------------
;; Behaviors are stored as a set of diffs that are merged together
;; to create the final set of functionality that makes up Light Table. You can
;; modify these diffs to either add or subtract functionality.
;;
;; Behaviors are added to tags, objects with those tags then automatically gain
;; whatever logic the behavior imparts. To see a list of user-level behaviors,
;; start typing a word related to the functionality you want in between the square
;; brackets (e.g. "theme").
